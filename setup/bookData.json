Dave Cockrum was the artist and architect of this newly revamped team, and he co-created Storm, Colossus, and, perhaps most notably, Nightcrawler. After the runaway success of Giant Size X-Men #1, the title began producing all-new stories with X-Men #94... and the rest is the stuff comic book dreams are made of! This Artifact Edition contains more than 100 pages from Cockrum's initial run on X-Men, as well as some pages when the artist returned later for a second run on the characters several years later. As with all Artist's Edition style books from IDW Publishing (which have so far won six Eisner Awards), the pages presented were all scanned from Cockrum's actual original art and are printed at the same size they were drawn, mimicking the look and feel of the artist's hand-drawn work. As an added bonus, there is a gallery section featuring covers, sketches, and a few surprises-this is an art book MADE for fans of Dave Cockrum's X-Men art!",

As a young journalist, Noah spends his days documenting the wondrous and terrifying shifts in the world around him. But Noah's life is changing, too. Falling in love and raising a rebellious daughter adds new meaning to lie in this mysterious floating world. As he covers the invention of new sports, interviews experts, and even journeys into space, each experience shapes how Noah views the world and, in turn, his relationship with his family. And as his daughter grows older, Noah faces the challenge every parent dreads and dreams of: letting go.  A Radical Shift of Gravity is a science-fiction fable: a graphic novel that explores the ties that bind a family together, the forces that threaten to pull them apart, and the quiet beauty of a world where everyone is floating away. Against the wondrous backdrop of massive planetary transformation, this stunning watercolor graphic novel explores one family's struggle to stay grounded.",

But when the artifact known as the Herald's Urn turns out to be deadlier than he bargained for, the risk may - just this once - outweigh the reward. With a chaos-crazed mercenary on Yondu's tail, he barely has time to plan his next move - and things get wilder when his enlightened, spiritual descendant from the 31st century arrives to help! Can the future Guardian of the Galaxy and the modern day Ravager set aside their differences long enough to survive - or will their divisiveness let the savage Sav'rkk pick them off one by one? The fate of the universe hangs in the balance - but when the smoke clears, only one Yondu will be left standing! Collecting YONDU #1-5. Rated T+ ",

But this was during South Korea's Fifth Republic, a military regime that entrenched its power through censorship, torture, and the murder of protestors.

She's sweet, geeky, and creative, but it's hard for her to make friends and connect with other people. She's like a lot of sensitive teenagers-but in the hands of graphic novelist Laura Lee Gulledge, Mona's struggle with depression takes on a vivid, concrete form. Mona calls it her Matter. The Matter gets everywhere, telling Mona she's not good enough, and that everyone around her wishes she would go away. But through therapy, art, writing, and the persistence of a few good friends, Mona starts to understand her Matter, and how she-and readers-can turn their fears into strengths. Heartfelt, emotionally vulnerable, and visually stunning, The Dark Matter of Mona Starr is a story that takes the inner life of a teenager seriously, while giving readers a new way to look at the universal quest for meaning and connection.

Its crews fully expected to be shot from the skies. Instead, they flew the ancient \"Stringbag\" into legend. From their triumphs against the Italian Fleet at Taranto and the mighty German battleship Bismarck in the Atlantic, to the deadly challenge of the Channel Dash in the bleak winter waters of their homeland. They lived as they flew, without a second to lose-and the greatest tributes to their courage would come from the enemy who strove to kill them.",
